## Hi there, I am Anmol ðŸ‘‹

I am currently pursuing Masters in Computer Science at Georgia Institute of Technology (with specialization in Computing Systems). 

I am currently part of [SAIL Lab](https://gatech-sysml.github.io) at Georgia Tech working to advance systems support and resource management for large scale models and democratize large-scale machine learning. I have also worked on and contributed to [EvaDB](https://github.com/georgia-tech-db/evadb) which a framework to integrate new AI models and leverage them through SQL APIs.

I am highly interested in Systems and Machine Learning domain, and am willing to work on/learn anything related these fields.
